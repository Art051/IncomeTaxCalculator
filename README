This is a tax calculator which takes income (without any reductions/amendments/allowances) and calculates PAYE
as well as Class 1 National Insurance HMRC state Personal Allowance is 12,570  -  https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates
If you use their calculator, it says the Personal Allowance is 12,579  -  https://www.gov.uk/estimate-income-tax

For this program I'll be using £12,579.

Below is the list of Tax bands and rates for 2020/21:

There is a reduction in Personal Allowance when an individual's taxable income exceeds £100,000.
For every £2 earned above £100,000 - the Personal Allowance reduces by £1, therefore paying 20% extra on the personal allowance adjustment.
Personal Allowance can be reduced to £0 - the reduction cannot result in a negative value.
The Tax Bandwidths are still applied beginning from the new Personal Allowance:
